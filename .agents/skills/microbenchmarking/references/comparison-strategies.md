# Comparing benchmark results

BenchmarkDotNet is most useful when alternatives are measured side-by-side under controlled conditions.

## Strategy 1: Side-by-side methods

When old/new implementations can coexist, define separate benchmark methods and mark one baseline:

```csharp
[Benchmark(Baseline = true)]
public int Baseline() => ExistingImplementation();

[Benchmark]
public int Candidate() => CandidateImplementation();
```

This is the preferred comparison when source-compatible alternatives can coexist.

## Strategy 2: Comparing runtimes

Use multiple target frameworks/jobs only when runtime version is the comparison axis. Multi-runtime BDN runs require the benchmark project to target all compared TFMs.

## Strategy 3: Comparing NuGet package versions

Use an MSBuild property or repository-supported mechanism to vary dependency version per job. In repositories using Central Package Management, keep version ownership centralized rather than adding inline package versions to projects.

Each compared version must remain source-compatible with the benchmark code.

## Strategy 4: Saved build vs current source

For before/after comparisons without published packages, a saved baseline DLL can be referenced by one BDN job while another job references current source. Keep namespace/API compatibility identical so the benchmark itself is not changing between jobs.

## Strategy 5: Runtime configuration

Use multiple jobs to compare GC/JIT/runtime settings when configuration itself is under investigation. Mark exactly one job as baseline.

## Strategy 6: Input scale

Use `[Params]` or equivalent parameter sources to evaluate scaling behavior. Prefer a small, intentional set of representative sizes; avoid accidental Cartesian explosions.

## Baselines

- Method comparison: use `[Benchmark(Baseline = true)]`.
- Multi-job comparison: mark one job with `.AsBaseline()`.

Without a baseline, BDN reports absolute values but no useful ratio column.

## Apples-to-apples comparisons

When comparing jobs, ensure measurement conditions are symmetric enough for the question. If the installed BDN version supports a controlled apples-to-apples comparison mode, validate its requirements before use rather than assuming invocation calibration is identical across jobs.

## Statistical interpretation

A small numeric difference is not automatically meaningful. Consider variance/error and, when useful, add an explicit equivalence test threshold so results can be classified as faster/same/slower instead of over-interpreting noise.
